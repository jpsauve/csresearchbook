# A Book Proposal: Doing Research in Computer Science

The title may change: I don’t like the word “doing”. It is a gerund and not very formal. But it may help to sell the book.

The only part of this proposal that is ready (in a first version) is the Annotated Table of Contents.

# Summary

To be included here: 
- A brief description of the book.
- The manuscript details (page count and how quickly the book can be completed).
- Special editorial features: A bulleted list of what makes this book stand out from an editorial and a publisher's perspective.
- List of chapter titles.
- One or two sentences about the authors.
- A 15 word, or less, sales pitch for the book.
- Key sales and marketing features: Four or five bulleted points about the book.

# Overview
A one or two paragraph summary of what will be in the book. This should read like the blurb on the back of the book. It tells the publisher in a concise form what the book is about, who the market is, and mentions a little about the authors.
About the Authors
This section provides detailed information about the authors. Why are we qualified to write this book? What is our education? Have we published before? Where do we work? 

# The Market
Whom do we see as the audience for the book? Why would somebody buy this book? How is this audience reached? For example, are there some magazines aimed at the same audience that the book is written for? Are there special conferences on this subject (when and where)? This section should be as numerical as possible.

# The Competition
What other books are in print on the same subject? How is this book different and better?

# Annotated Table of Contents
A detailed chapter outline follows.

### Chapter 1: Do we Have a Problem?
This chapter presents evidence to show that the computing research community has a serious quality problem, making this book important. The main topics included are:

- Are researchers in computing prepared to do research?
- Are we different? A comparison of research in Computer Science and in other fields of science
- Evaluating the quality of papers published in computing
- What does it mean to be a trained scientist?
- This book as a training manual for computer scientists

The book is organized along two main dimensions: communicating effectively (Parts I and III) and doing research effectively (Parts II and IV).

## Part I: Communicating Effectively: Reading
Reading well is a difficult art that is honed through practice. However, there are techniques that, once understood, will help the researcher obtain better understanding of whatever material is read, and in a shorter length of time.

### Chapter 2: How to Read a Scientific Paper: Extracting Meaning from the Written Page
After concluding this chapter, the reader will know what it mean to _read well_ and how to do it: extracting meaning from the written page in an efficient and effective manner.

- Why reading well is hard: passive versus active reading
- How do you become an active reader? 
    - Ask questions!
    - Personalize the paper!
    - Read in phases, not sequentially
- Reading in phases: superficial and in-depth reading
- What basic questions should you ask?
    - What’s the problem?
    - Why is it important?
    - What’s the contribution?
    - What are the main results and conclusions?
- How to be critical about what you read: ask more questions
- Evaluating the consequences of your reading activity

### Chapter 3: What to Read: Doing a Literature Review
This chapter shows how to understand the state-of-the-art in a given research area by performing a literature review (or survey).
